    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="lead">Effective date: November 19, 2025</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p><strong>Mylo</strong> is designed to operate fully offline and to keep your legal records private and local to your device. This Privacy Policy explains what data (if any) Mylo collects, how it is used, and your rights.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> Mylo does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store personal data to our servers. All information you enter into the application remains stored locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>2. Offline Storage</h2>
  <p>All application data — including client records, case files, contacts, transactions, meetings, and assets — is stored locally on your Android or ChromeOS device. Mylo does not back up, sync, or otherwise transfer that data to any cloud service by default.</p>

  <h2>3. Network Usage & Advertising</h2>
  <p>Mylo’s core functionality does not require an internet connection. When your device is online, a small banner ad may appear at the bottom of the screen. The app itself does not collect or transmit personal or business data for advertising purposes.</p>
  <p class="muted">If you later integrate a third-party ad SDK or analytics provider, that provider may have its own data collection practices. We will disclose any such third-party data use in this policy if/when it is added.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Mylo does not use third-party analytics, trackers, or cloud services for core features. If in a future release third-party services are added, we will update this policy to describe what information is shared and provide links to those providers' privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect data stored on your device. Because data is stored locally, standard device security (screen lock, file encryption provided by the OS) helps protect your records. We cannot guarantee absolute security against every threat; please secure your device and backups appropriately.</p>

  <h2>6. Children</h2>
  <p>Mylo is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Legal & Regulatory Rights</h2>
  <p>If you are in a region with data-protection laws (for example, GDPR or CCPA), you may have rights regarding personal data collection, access, correction, or deletion. Because Mylo does not collect or transmit personal data to us, there is no personal data held by Mylo to access or delete. If that changes, this policy will be updated and specific instructions will be provided.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If material changes are made (for example, if we begin collecting data or add third-party services that collect data), we will post the updated policy here with a new effective date.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or Mylo’s handling of data, contact us at: <a href="mailto:nano.musty@gmail.com">nano.musty@gmail.com</a>.</p>
