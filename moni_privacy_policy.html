    <p class="muted"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 12, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Moni – Finance Tracker</strong> is a mobile application designed to help users manage their income and expenses. This privacy policy explains how the application handles data, third-party services, and your privacy rights.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Moni does not collect, store, or process any personal information from users. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No account creation or login is required.</li>
      <li>No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.</li>
      <li>No behavioral analytics are gathered by the app itself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services & Advertising</h2>
    <p>The app may display advertisements through <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may automatically collect technical information such as device identifiers, IP address, or app usage data for the purpose of serving personalized ads. This data is collected and processed by Google, not Moni.</p>

    <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Moni does not directly use cookies or tracking technologies. However, third-party ad networks (like Google AdMob) may implement their own tracking mechanisms in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
